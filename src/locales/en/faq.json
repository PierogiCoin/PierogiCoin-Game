    "q1": "What is PierogiCoin (PRG)?",
    "a1": "PierogiCoin (PRG) is a community-driven token merging tradition with innovation. We aim to build a secure and fun ecosystem backed by real value.",
    "q2": "How can I get PierogiCoin tokens?",
    "a2": "We are not selling tokens traditionally yet. You can secure an allocation by: 1) Playing our Telegram Game, 2) Contributing to the Audit Funding Hub.",
    "q3": "What is the utility of PRG?",
    "a3": "PRG is the heart of the ecosystem. It's used for staking, game rewards, and in the future, for payments at partner restaurants.",
    "q4": "Has the smart contract been audited?",
    "a4": "That's exactly what we are raising funds for! We are in the 'Play-to-Audit' phase. We won't launch the main sale until CertiK or Hacken confirms our code is 100% secure.",
    "q5": "What is the development plan?",
    "a5": "First Audit (Q1 2025), then Public Launch, CEX listings, and expanding the PierogiCoin gaming universe.",
    "q6": "How can I join the community?",
    "a6": "Join our Telegram and Discord! That's where the action is – daily discussions, memes, and direct access to the team.",
    "q7": "Why fund the audit through a game?",
    "a7": "Because we believe in transparency. Instead of seeking VCs, we prefer the community to fund the audit and own the project's success.",
    "q8": "How does the Telegram game help?",
    "a8": "Revenue from game ads and voluntary donations goes 100% to the Audit Vault. You play for free, and we gather funds for security.",
    "q9": "When is the official Presale?",
    "a9": "Only after a successful audit. We target Q1 2025. User fund security is our top priority.",
    "q10": "Are game tokens tradable?",
    "a10": "Yes, after the official Token Generation Event (TGE), tokens earned in-game will be unlocked and tradable on exchanges."
